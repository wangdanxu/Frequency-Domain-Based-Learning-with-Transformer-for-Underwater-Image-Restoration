# Frequency-Domain-Based-Learning-with-Transformer-for-Underwater-Image-Restoration
Underwater images restoration is a corrective procedure aiming to eliminate the variations caused by the scattering and severe absorption of light when propagating in water. Holistic approaches dominate underwater image restoration by considering colour compensation on the blue channel through CNNs. In this paper, we discard the previous CNN-based network by employing Vision Transformer as the strong baseline for Underwater Image Restoration. To further boost the restoration, we investigate the impact of the frequency domain where higher frequencies represent more detailed information corresponding to the image, which hasn’t been widely studied in this field. To this end, a novel loss function is adopted as the regularization defined in the spectral domain. By learning more detailed frequency information of the whole image, our proposed pipeline further enhances the accuracy of the baseline model achieving state-of-art performance on EUVP, UIEB and UFO-120 datasets
